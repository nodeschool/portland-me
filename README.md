>Learn Javascript & NodeJS through self-paced interactive workshops!

Nodeschool Portland, Maine is part of the global Nodeschool effort to voluntarily teach NodeJS to anyone! The source code for the workshops is completely open source and the effort is entirely community driven. And the best part is, it's all free!

Nodeschool events have been held around the world, and successfully introduce beginners to Javascript, Node, and the command line. You can do NodeSchool workshops from home, but the in-person events give you a chance to learn in **an inclusive, collaborative environment**, & also to help other beginners if you already have JS/Node experience.
