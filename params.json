The source code for the workshops is completely open source and the effort is entirely community driven. And the best part is, it's all free!\r\n\r\nNodeschool events have been held around the world, and successfully introduce beginners to Javascript, Node, and the command line. You can do NodeSchool workshops from home, but the in-person events give you a chance to learn in **an inclusive, collaborative environment**, & also to help other beginners if you already have JS/Node experience.\r\n\r\nThe Portland, Maine chapter of Nodeschool was launched by [Carlo DiCelico](https://github.com/carlodicelico).\r\n\r\nLearn more about the international Nodeschool community at [nodeschool.io](nodeschool.io)\r\n\r\n## Contact & Events\r\n* [Nodeschool Portland, ME website](http://nodeschool.io/portland-me)\r\n* [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Portland-Maine-Nodeschool)\r\n* [Github](https://github.com/nodeschool/portland-me)\r\n* [Gitter](https://gitter.im/nodeschool/portland-me)\r\n* Organizers: [Carlo DiCelico](https://github.com/carlodicelico)\r\n* Mentors:\r\n\r\n## Attend\r\n\r\nUpcoming workshops are posted on [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Portland-Maine-Nodeschool). Workshops are hands-on, so while bringing a laptop is *not* required, doing so would really allow you to get the greatest benefit.\r\n\r\n## Mentor\r\n\r\nWant to be a mentor? Contact any of the organizers and we'll get you set up!\r\n\r\n## Sponsor\r\n\r\nWe can't put on Nodeschool events here in Portland without some help from awesome sponsors. As of right now we have two types of somewhat loosely-defined sponsorship opportunities:\r\n\r\n###Space sponsorship\r\n\r\nProviding a location to meet with adequate space, collaborative seating, good location, parking if possible, and solid wi-fi internet and other technical needs such as projector, sound for music, etc.\r\n\r\n###Financial sponsorship\r\n\r\nCurrently this amount is at $200 (per event) to go toward food, drinks, supplies (signs, name badges, posters, etc) and swag (printing stickers, lanyards for mentors, t-shirts are a possibility).\r\n\r\nPayPal or advance check works best here, but some companies prefer to pick up food/drinks themselves and bring them to the event, for example. We'll work with whatever works for you. :)\r\n\r\n###What you get\r\n\r\nAt either of these levels, your company name/description goes on our website, you're free to bring a sign and/or swag to put up at the event, and you can give a quick 2 minute plug during the event at some point.\r\n\r\nThis is also a pretty good opportunity to get in front of area Node developers if you'd like to mention job opportunities.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in sponsoring, reach out to any of the organizers outlining what kind of sponsorship you're interested in and we'll work with you to figure out what works best.\r\n\r\n## Code of Conduct\r\n\r\nWe, the organizers of Nodeschool Portland, ME, are dedicated to providing a\r\nharassment-free, inclusive community for everyone, regardless of sex, gender identity or\r\nexpression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body\r\nsize, race, nationality, or religious beliefs.
