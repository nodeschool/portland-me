<blockquote>
<p>Learn Javascript &amp; NodeJS through self-paced interactive workshops!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nodeschool Portland, Maine is part of the global Nodeschool effort to voluntarily teach NodeJS to anyone! The source code for the workshops is completely open source and the effort is entirely community driven. And the best part is, it's all free!</p>

<p>Nodeschool events have been held around the world, and successfully introduce beginners to Javascript, Node, and the command line. You can do NodeSchool workshops from home, but the in-person events give you a chance to learn in <strong>an inclusive, collaborative environment</strong>, &amp; also to help other beginners if you already have JS/Node experience.</p>

<p>Upcoming workshops are posted on <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Portland-Maine-Nodeschool">Meetup</a>. Workshops are hands-on, so while bringing a laptop is <em>not</em> required, doing so would really allow you to get the greatest benefit.</p>

<h2>
<a id="mentor" class="anchor" href="#mentor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Mentor</h2>

<p>Want to be a mentor? Contact any of the organizers and we'll get you <a href="https://github.com/orgs/nodeschool/teams/portland-me">on the team</a>!</p>

<h2>
<a id="sponsor" class="anchor" href="#sponsor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Sponsor</h2>

<p>We can't put on Nodeschool events here in Portland without some help from awesome sponsors. As of right now we have two types of somewhat loosely-defined sponsorship opportunities:</p>

<h3>
<a id="space-sponsorship" class="anchor" href="#space-sponsorship" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Space sponsorship</h3>

<p>Providing a location to meet with adequate space, collaborative seating, good location, parking if possible, and solid wi-fi internet and other technical needs such as projector, sound for music, etc.</p>

<h3>
<a id="financial-sponsorship" class="anchor" href="#financial-sponsorship" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Financial sponsorship</h3>

<p>Currently this amount is at $200 (per event) to go toward food, drinks, supplies (signs, name badges, posters, etc) and swag (printing stickers, lanyards for mentors, t-shirts are a possibility).</p>

<p>PayPal or advance check works best here, but some companies prefer to pick up food/drinks themselves and bring them to the event, for example. We'll work with whatever works for you. :)</p>

<h3>
<a id="what-you-get" class="anchor" href="#what-you-get" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What you get</h3>

<p>At either of these levels, your company name/description goes on our website, you're free to bring a sign and/or swag to put up at the event, and you can give a quick 2 minute plug during the event at some point.</p>

<p>This is also a pretty good opportunity to get in front of area Node developers if you'd like to mention job opportunities.</p>

<p>If you're interested in sponsoring, reach out to any of the organizers outlining what kind of sponsorship you're interested in and we'll work with you to figure out what works best.</p>
